abstract = "The growing complexity of heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) has necessitated a variety of user and base station (BS) configurations to be considered for realistic performance evaluation and system design. This is directly reflected in the HetNet simulation models proposed by standardization bodies, such as the third generation partnership project (3GPP). Complementary to these simulation models, stochastic geometry-based approach, modeling the locations of the users and the K tiers of BSs as independent and homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs), has gained prominence in the past few years. Despite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based $K$-tier HetNet model is not rich enough to capture spatial coupling between user and BS locations that exists in real-world HetNet deployments and is included in 3GPP simulation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that modeling a fraction of users and arbitrary number of BS tiers alternatively with a Poisson cluster process (PCP) captures the aforementioned coupling, thus bridging the gap between the 3GPP simulation models and the PPP-based analytic model for HetNets. We further show that the downlink coverage probability of a typical user under maximum signal-to-interference-ratio association can be expressed in terms of the sum-product functionals over PPP, PCP, and its associated offspring point process, which are all characterized as a part of our analysis. We also show that the proposed model converges to the PPP-based HetNet model as the cluster size of the PCPs tends to infinity. Finally, we specialize our analysis based on general PCPs for Thomas and Matern cluster processes. Special instances of the proposed model closely resemble the different configurations for BS and user locations considered in 3GPP simulations."
