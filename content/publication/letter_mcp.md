abstract = "In this letter, we derive the cumulative density function (CDF) of the nearest neighbor and contact distance distributions of the Matérn cluster process (MCP) in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These results will be useful in the performance analysis of many realworld wireless networks that exhibit inter-node attraction. Using these results, we concretely demonstrate that the contact distance of the MCP stochastically dominates its nearest-neighbor distance as well as the contact distance of the homogenous Poisson point process (PPP) with the same density."
